## Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Website

Welcome to the official repository for the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company website! This project is a fictional representation of a paper company's online presence, created for personal practise purposes. The website allows users to explore various paper products and place orders. Also allowing user and inventory management. It is built using C# and ASP .NET Core MVC.

This application has seed data for users thus can be ran and tested on the go. Please note that the project is incomplete and some functionality will not be available.

## Feature Goals
My goal is a website that features the following:
- Users should be able to register and login as a customer or as an employee (implemented)
- Employees are added by those in roles that have more authority (CEO and Manager)
- Customers should be able to view all products, altogether or by category (implemented)
- Customers should be able to view the details of a product, add a product to cart and to wishlist (implemented)
- Customers should be able to place orders through a checkout page and view details of placed orders, cancel orders and view the order history (implemented)
- Customers should be able to add addresses of where they expect their orders to be delivered to (implemented)
- Customers should be able to select whether an order should be delivery or will be collected by the customer (implemented)
- A CEO should be able to add a manager and a manager should be able to add a salesperson
- A salesperson should be able to process an order from the list of all placed orders (implemented)
- A salesperson shoul be able top add a product to inventory and edit any existing product details (image, name, price, quantity, description, type) (implemented)
- Good user experience by adding user friendly error messages and alerts (implemented)


Note: *These goals are subject to change as I build the project and find new ideas to try out*
