# DunderMifflin
Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Website

Welcome to the official repository for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company website! This project is a fictional representation of a paper company's online presence, created for personal practise purposes. The website allows users to explore various paper products and place orders. It is built using C# and ASP .NET Core MVC.

## Feature Goals
My goal is a website that features the following:
- Users should be able to register and login as a customer (implemented)
- Employees are added by those in roles that have more authority (CEO and Manager) (implemented)
- Customers should be able to view all products, altogether or by category (implemented)
- Customers should be able to view the details of a product, add a product to cart and to wishlist (implemented)
- Customers should be able to place orders and view placed orders (implemented), cancel orders and view the order history
- A CEO should be able to add a manager and a manager a salesperson
- A salesperson should be able to process an order from the list of all placed orders
- Good user experience by adding user friendly error messages and alerts

*Goals not tagged with (implemented) may be partially implemented*
*These goals are subject to change as I build the project and find new ideas to try out*
