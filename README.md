# DunderMifflin
Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Website

Welcome to the official repository for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company website! This project is a fictional representation of a paper company's online presence, created for personal practise purposes. The website allows users to explore various paper products and place orders. It is built using C# and ASP .NET Core MVC.

## Goal
My goal is a website that features the following:
1. Users should be able to register and login as a customer (implemented)
2. Employees are added by those in roles that have more authority (CEO and Manager) (implemented)
3. Customers should be able to view all products, altogether or by category (implemented)
4. Customers should be able to view the details of a product, add a product to cart and to wishlist (implemented)
5. Customers should be able to place orders and view placed orders (implemented), cancel orders and view the order history
6. A CEO should be able to add a manager and a manager a salesperson
7. A salesperson should be able to process an order from the list of all placed orders

*Goals not tagged with (implemented) may be partially implemented
*These goals are subject to change as I build the project and find new ideas to try out
